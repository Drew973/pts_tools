split by curvature:

	feature based processing algorithm.

	parameters:
		input layer
		threshold
		interval. 5m default seems reasonable
		lengthField: optional. scale chainages so section length matches this

	output layer: same fields as input layer + start_chainage + end_chainage

	extract parts of linestring where curvature >= threshold.

	estimate curvatures at fixed interval. join to neiboring intervals if >= threshold



	may need parts where curvature<threshold for some distance. user can filter by end_chainage-start_chainage for this.
	user can filter by speed limit.
