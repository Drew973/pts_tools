        <h2 id="split_by_chainage">Split by Chainage</h2>
		<p>Algorithm to split features into equal lengths and remainder.</p>

		<p>Creates new layer:</p>
			<li>Containing 1 or more features per input feature.</li>
			<li>With additional fields source_id,start_chainage and end_chainage (source_id is feature id of input feature).</li>
		

	<h3> Parameters:</h3>
		<li>Input layer</li>
		<li>Step: length for pieces. For reverse direction (decreasing chainages) make this negative.
		</li>
				

		<li>Section length field: If set section length is treated as this,otherwise geometry length is used.</li>
		<li>Output layer</li>

	<h3> Examples:</h3>

		<li> 25 m feature with step of +10m will become 0-10 10-20,20-25 m pieces.</li>
		<li> 25 m feature with step of -10m will become 25-15,15-5,5-0 m pieces.</li>


	<h3>2D vs 3D geometry</h3>

		<li> Split by chainage can work with 2D and 3D geometries.</li>
		<li> Networks supplied by clients usually have 2D geometries(no altitude).</li>
		<li> Section lengths calculated from 2D geometry will be shorter than the actual 3D length of the road.</li>
		<li> Chainage measured along 3D road will be different to chainage calculated as the crow flies from 2D geometry.</li>
